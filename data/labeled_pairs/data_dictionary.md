# Data Dictionary — AISE Labeled Pairs (v1)

**File:** `data/labeled_pairs/AISE_labeled_pairs_v1.csv`  
Each row = one labeled pair (O*NET job description ↔ startup description).

> Column names contain spaces by design.  
> In Python/pandas, use `df['job description']`.  
> In R, use backticks if needed: `df$`job description``.

| Column               | Type   | Description |
|----------------------|--------|-------------|
| job description      | string | Short job description text from **O*NET**. |
| startup description  | string | Startup description text from **Y Combinator Startups** and **EU Startups** datasets. |
| label                | boolean (string) | `True` if the startup is relevant for the tasks in the job description; `False` otherwise. |
| justification        | string | Short rationale for the label (generated by **GPT-5**). May reference key terms that drove the decision. |


## Known Limitations
- Short descriptions may omit context, leading to borderline labels.
- Justifications are model-generated; they may be imperfect—treat them as auxiliary.

## Licensing
Unless otherwise noted in the CSV, the dataset is released under **CC BY 4.0** (see `LICENSE-DATA`). Cite the dataset and the accompanying paper.
