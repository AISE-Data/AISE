Below is a list of data posted on this page:

- **Data Appendix A: AISE Scores by Occupation.**  
  Contains the constructed **AI Startup Exposure (AISE)** and related metrics by occupation indexed by **O*NET-SOC code**.  
  **File:** `data/occupations/AISE_occupations_v1.csv`  
  **Key columns:**  
  - `O*NET-SOC Code` — O*NET occupation code (e.g., 15-1252.00)  
  - `Title` — occupation title  
  - `AISE` — AI Startup Exposure (as defined in the paper)  
  - `complementarity` — complementarity index following *Pizzinelli et al. (2023)*  
  - `job zone` — O*NET Job Zone (education/training level)  
  - `robotic` — Robotic Startup Exposure (RSE) from the paper’s supplementary information  
  See `data/occupations/data_dictionary.md` for full definitions.

- **Data Appendix B: Labeled Job–Startup Pairs.**  
  Contains a **human-labeled subset** matching O*NET job descriptions with startup descriptions (from Y Combinator Startups and EU Startups datasets).  
  **File:** `data/labeled_pairs/AISE_labeled_pairs_v1.csv`  
  **Columns:**  
  - `job description` — short job description text from O*NET  
  - `startup description` — startup description text (YC / EU Startups)  
  - `label` — `True` if the startup is relevant for the job’s tasks; `False` otherwise  
  - `justification` — brief rationale for the label (generated by GPT-5)  
  See `data/labeled_pairs/data_dictionary.md` for details, sources, and labeling notes.

In addition, this repository may be updated to include derived indicators and robustness checks related to **AI exposure** (AISE) and **Robotic Startup Exposure (RSE)**.
